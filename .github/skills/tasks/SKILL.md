## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Prerequisites Check

Before generating tasks, verify:

1. **Scope completeness acknowledged**:
   - Check for `FEATURE_DIR/scope-inventory.md`
   - Verify scope coverage: in_scope_items / total_discovered
   - If coverage < 100%: Require user acknowledgment of partial scope
   - Display: "Generating tasks for M of N discovered items (X% coverage)"

2. **Spec-to-Plan checkpoint exists and passes**:
   - Check for `FEATURE_DIR/checkpoints/spec-to-plan.yaml`
   - Verify `validation.passed == true`
   - If missing or failed: ERROR "Plan checkpoint validation failed. Run planning skill first."

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
   - Bash example: `.github/skills/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` 
   - PowerShell example: `.github/skills/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json`

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Required**: Knowledge graph (module dependencies and code structure)
   - **Required**: checkpoints/spec-to-plan*.yaml (for upstream traceability)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Extract plan item inventory** (for checkpoint generation):
   - Parse plan.md for all phase items (Phase-X, item X.Y)
   - Create plan items inventory with: phase, item_id, description
   - Load upstream traceability from spec-to-plan checkpoint

4. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - Load knowledge graph (module dependencies and code structure)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - **CRITICAL**: Each task MUST reference its source plan item
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

5. **Generate Plan-to-Tasks Checkpoint**:
   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checkpoints/plan-to-tasks.yaml`
   - Use template: `skills/templates/plan-to-tasks-checkpoint-template.yaml`
   - Map each plan item to generated tasks
   - Include upstream traceability (REQ → Phase → Task)
   - Identify orphan tasks (no plan item trace)
   - Calculate coverage percentage

6. **Validate Checkpoint**:
   ```
   CRITICAL ERRORS (must fix before proceeding):
   - Any plan item with status: "missing"
   - Coverage percentage < 100%
   
   WARNINGS (document but can proceed):
   - Orphan tasks (may be valid utility tasks)
   ```

7. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.github/skills/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Delegate heavy tasks to sub-agents if needed
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - **NEW**: Include traceability reference in each task (plan item ID)
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

8. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md, checkpoint, and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
   - **Checkpoint validation results**

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Guideline Task Integration

Before generating tasks, check for applicable guidelines:

1. **Scan `skills/guidelines/`** for matching technology patterns from plan.md
2. **For each matching guideline**:
   - Load the SKILL.md migration checklist
   - Map checklist items to task phases
   - Generate specific transformation tasks with file paths
3. **Guideline tasks follow the same format**:
   - `- [ ] T0XX [P] [US?] [GUIDELINE:skill-name] Description with file path`
   - Example: `- [ ] T015 [P] [GUIDELINE:convert-action-to-controller] Convert HelloAction.java to Spring Controller`
4. **Document applied guidelines** in tasks.md header:
   ```markdown
   ## Applied Guidelines
   - struts-to-spring: 14 migration tasks generated
   ```

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] [Plan:X.Y] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **[Plan:X.Y] marker**: REQUIRED - References source plan item for traceability
   - Format: [Plan:2.1] means "from Phase 2, item 1"
   - Enables checkpoint generation to verify complete plan coverage
   - Multiple plan items can be referenced: [Plan:2.1,2.3]
6. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 [Plan:1.1] Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] [Plan:2.1] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] [Plan:2.2] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] [Plan:2.2,2.3] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID, Plan reference, and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox and Plan reference)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID and Plan reference)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing Plan reference and file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Checkpoint Generation

### Step-by-Step Checkpoint Creation

After tasks.md is complete, generate the traceability checkpoint:

1. **Create checkpoint file**: `FEATURE_DIR/checkpoints/plan-to-tasks.yaml`

2. **Extract plan item inventory from plan.md**:
   ```yaml
   # Scan plan for phase items
   plan_items_found:
     - phase_id: "Phase-2"
       item_id: "2.1"
       description: "Replace Struts filter with Spring DispatcherServlet"
     - phase_id: "Phase-2"
       item_id: "2.2"
       description: "Implement controllers for routes"
   ```

3. **Extract task inventory from tasks.md**:
   ```yaml
   # Scan tasks for [Plan:X.Y] references
   tasks_found:
     - task_id: "T005"
       description: "Remove struts2-core dependency from pom.xml"
       plan_refs: ["2.1"]
     - task_id: "T006"
       description: "Add spring-webmvc dependency to pom.xml"
       plan_refs: ["2.1"]
   ```

4. **Build coverage mapping**:
   - For each plan item: find all tasks referencing it via [Plan:X.Y]
   - For each task: verify it has at least one plan item reference
   - Mark plan items as: covered | partial | missing
   - Mark tasks as: traced | orphan

5. **Include upstream traceability**:
   - Load spec-to-plan checkpoint
   - Link requirements → plan items → tasks
   - Build full trace chains: REQ-001 → Phase-2.1 → T005,T006,T007

6. **Generate checkpoint YAML**:
   ```yaml
   # checkpoints/plan-to-tasks.yaml
   metadata:
     generated: "2026-01-30"
     source_plan: "plan.md"
     target_tasks: "tasks.md"
   
   summary:
     total_plan_items: 8
     covered_plan_items: 8
     missing_plan_items: 0
     coverage_percentage: 100.0
     total_tasks_generated: 25
     orphan_tasks: 1
   
   phases:
     - phase_id: "Phase-2"
       phase_name: "Implementation"
       items:
         - item_id: "2.1"
           description: "Replace Struts filter with Spring DispatcherServlet"
           tasks:
             - task_id: "T005"
               description: "Remove struts2-core dependency"
             - task_id: "T006"
               description: "Add spring-webmvc dependency"
             - task_id: "T007"
               description: "Configure DispatcherServlet"
           status: "covered"
   
   missing_plan_items: []
   
   orphan_tasks:
     - task_id: "T099"
       description: "General cleanup"
       concern: "No [Plan:X.Y] reference found"
   
   upstream_trace:
     - plan_item: "2.1"
       source_requirements: ["REQ-001", "REQ-002"]
       tasks: ["T005", "T006", "T007"]
       full_trace: "REQ-001,002 → Phase-2.1 → T005,T006,T007"
   
   validation:
     passed: true
     errors: []
     warnings: ["Task T099 has no plan item traceability"]
   ```

7. **Validation Gate**:
   - If `validation.passed == false`: 
     - Display missing plan items
     - Ask user to either:
       a) Add tasks to cover missing plan items
       b) Explicitly mark plan item as deferred (with justification)
     - Do NOT proceed to implementation until resolved

### End-to-End Traceability Report

After checkpoint generation, output a summary table:

```markdown
## Traceability Summary

| Requirement | Plan Phase | Plan Item | Tasks | Status |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| REQ-001 | Phase-2 | 2.1 | T005, T006, T007 | ✓ Complete |
| REQ-002 | Phase-2 | 2.1, 2.2 | T005-T010 | ✓ Complete |
| REQ-003 | Phase-3 | 3.1 | T015 | ✓ Complete |
| REQ-004 | - | - | - | ❌ MISSING |
```

This table provides at-a-glance visibility into complete coverage from requirements through implementation tasks.
