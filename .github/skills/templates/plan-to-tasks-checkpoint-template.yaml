# Detailed plan-to-tasks mapping organized by phase
phases:
  # Example entry:
  # - phase_id: "Phase-2"
  #   phase_name: "Implementation"
  #   items:
  #     - item_id: "2.1"
  #       description: "Replace Struts filter with Spring DispatcherServlet"
  #       tasks:
  #         - task_id: "T005"
  #           description: "Remove struts2-core dependency from pom.xml"
  #         - task_id: "T006"
  #           description: "Add spring-webmvc dependency to pom.xml"
  #         - task_id: "T007"
  #           description: "Configure DispatcherServlet in web.xml"
  #       status: "covered"  # covered | missing | partial
  #       notes: ""

# Plan items with no task coverage (HIGH - must be resolved)
missing_plan_items: []
  # Example:
  # - phase_id: "Phase-2"
  #   item_id: "2.3"
  #   description: "Add audit logging"
  #   reason: "No tasks generated for this item"

# Tasks with no plan item traceability (WARNING - may indicate scope creep or utility tasks)
orphan_tasks: []
  # Example:
  # - task_id: "T099"
  #   description: "General code cleanup"
  #   concern: "No corresponding plan item - verify if intentional utility task"

# Upstream traceability (linking back to spec requirements)
upstream_trace:
  # Maps plan items back to their source requirements for end-to-end traceability
  # Example:
  # - plan_item: "2.1"
  #   source_requirements: ["REQ-001", "REQ-002"]
  #   tasks: ["T005", "T006", "T007"]
  #   full_trace: "REQ-001,REQ-002 → Phase-2.1 → T005,T006,T007"

# Validation result
validation:
  passed: false
  errors: []
  warnings: []
  # errors example: ["Plan item 2.3 has no task coverage"]
  # warnings example: ["Task T099 has no plan item traceability"]
